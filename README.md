# SQL-Codes
The file in this Repository contains all the SQL code exercises I had to go through in order to learn SQL and obtain a certificate in it from a data science platform called 365DataScience. If skimmed well, the file shows that there are all different kinds of exercises that I had to perform in SQL, all ranging from basic to Advanced topics.
